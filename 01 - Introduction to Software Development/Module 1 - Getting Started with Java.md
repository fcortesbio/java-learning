### Unique Selling Points:

- **Insights from Amazon Web Developers:** Gain practical knowledge and insights directly from experienced software developers at Amazon.

- **Online Assessment Preparation**: The course includes preparation for the technical assessments commonly used by top tech companies in their interview processes.

## **1.2 Course Introduction**:

### Key Learning Areas:

- **The Developer Role**: You will begin by exploring the day-to-day responsibilities of a software developer and learn about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which is the framework for planning, building, and maintaining software.

- **Java Fundamentals**: The course covers the basic building blocks of programming, including:
  - **Variables, Data Types, and Operators** for handling data.

  - **Strings and Arrays** for manipulating text.

- **Control Flow**: You will learn how to make your programs dynamic and intelligent using:
  - **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else`, `switch`) to make decisions based on different scenarios.

  - **Loops** (`for`, `while`) to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The course introduces the core principles of OOP, teaching you how to organize code using **classes** (blueprints) and **methods** (behaviors) to create scalable and reusable solutions.

### **Project-Based Learning**:

Throughout the course, you will apply these concepts by working on a **virtual zoo application**. This final project integrates all the skills you've learned, demonstrating your ability to solve a practical problem with code.

### **Outcome**:

By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in Java programming and software development principles, giving you the confidence and skills needed for internships, apprenticeships, and more advanced courses.

## **1.3. Virtual Zoo - Project Preview**

The final project requires you to apply all the Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts from the course to build a functional **"virtual zoo"** application.

### **Objectives**:

- evaluate your understanding of core Jaav and OOP principles
- demostrate your ability to integrate multiple skills into a single, working program
- showcase your ability to create unique, manageable, and non-repetitive code

### **Core tasks & concepts**

**1. Use inheritance**: You will creatae a base `Animal` class and then extend it to create specific child classes like `Tiger` and `Dolphin`. This is designed to teach code reuse.

**2. Implement Behaviors with Interfaces**: You will use interfaces to add distinct behaviours to your animals, such as `Walking` or `Swimming`.

**3. Handle Multiple Behaviours**: You will create a `Penguin` class that implements both the `Walking` and `Swimming` interfaces to demonstrate how an object can have multiple, distinct functionalities.

**4. Createa a User-Controlled Menu**: You will build a menu-based system that allows the user to:
  - Choose an animal (Tiger, Dolphin, or Penguin)
  - Display and modify the animal's characteristics.
  - Trigger the animal behaviors
  - Exit the program cleanly with a "quit" option

The final result will be a complete, menu-driven application that proves your ability to use key OOP concepts to build a creative and functional program

## **Course syllabus: Introduction to software development**

This course is your starting point for learning software development with the Java programming language. It's designed to give you the foundational skills needed for a career in tech.

### **Course Modules**

The course is broken down into four key modules:

- **Module 1**: Getting Started with Java: learn about the role of a software developer, set up your coding environment, and write your first simple Java programs

- **Module 2**: Control Flow: learn how to make your programs smarter by using conditional statements (like if/else) for decision-making and loops to automate repetitive tasks.

- **Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**: learn the fundamentals of OOP, a crucial industry practice for writing organized, reusable, and efficient code using concepts like classes and abstraction.

- **Module 4: Final Project and Assessment**: apply all your new skills to a hands-on project: building a complete software application to manage a fictional zoo

### **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Understand the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- Write and run basic Java programs.
- Use control structures to manage program flow.
- Apply fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Your progress will be evaluated with the final zoo project and a course quiz.
