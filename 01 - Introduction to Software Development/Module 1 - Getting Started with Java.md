### **Objectives**:

- Evaluate your understanding of core Java and OOP principles
- Demonstrate your ability to integrate multiple skills into a single, working program
- Showcase your ability to create unique, manageable, and non-repetitive code

### **Core Tasks & Concepts**

**1. Use Inheritance**: You will create a base `Animal` class and then extend it to create specific child classes like `Tiger` and `Dolphin`. This is designed to teach code reuse.

**2. Implement Behaviors with Interfaces**: You will use interfaces to add distinct behaviors to your animals, such as `Walking` or `Swimming`.

**3. Handle Multiple Behaviors**: You will create a `Penguin` class that implements both the `Walking` and `Swimming` interfaces to demonstrate how an object can have multiple, distinct functionalities.

**4. Create a User-Controlled Menu**: You will build a menu-based system that allows the user to:

- Choose an animal (Tiger, Dolphin, or Penguin)
- Display and modify the animal's characteristics
- Trigger the animal behaviors
- Exit the program cleanly with a "quit" option

The final result will be a complete, menu-driven application that proves your ability to use key OOP concepts to build a creative and functional program

Software development is the process of designing, creating, and maintaining software applications to solve real-world problems. It's like being a digital architect.

A developer's tasks include:

- **Understanding Requirements**: Working with clients to figure out what the software needs to do (**functional**), how it should perform (**non-functional**), and which technologies to use (**technical**)

- **Designing Solutions**: Planning the software's architecture and breaking it down into smaller, manageable components.

- **Coding**: Writing the actual code using a programming language (like Java) to bring the design to life

- **Testing and Debugging**: Finding and fixing bugs and errors to ensure the software works correctly

- **Collaboration**: Working in a team with other developers, designers and project managers

- **Version Control**: Using tools like **Git** to track code changes, which helps prevent mistakes and makes teamwork easier

- **Documentation**: Writing clear comments and manuals so the code is understandable to others and your future self

- **Continuous Learning**: Staying up-to-date with new tools, languages, and technologies in the ever-evolving world of tech

## **1.6. Areas of Expertise**

Software development has several areas of expertise. The three main paths for web and application development are **frontend**, **backend**, and **full-stack**.

### Frontend Development

This specialization focuses on the **visual part** of an application‚Äîeverything the user sees and interacts with. It‚Äôs all about creating a beautiful and intuitive user experience (UX).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Building **user interfaces (UI)** with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Ensuring the application works well across different browsers and devices (**responsive design**).
- Optimizing the application for speed and performance.
- Collaborating closely with designers to bring their vision to life.

### Backend Development

This is the **"engine room"** of an application. The backend handles everything that happens behind the scenes, like data storage, security, and the core logic that makes the application work. ‚öôÔ∏è

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Writing **server-side code** to process requests and perform tasks.
- Managing **databases** to store and retrieve information.
- Building **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) so the frontend and backend can communicate.
- Implementing security measures to protect data.
- Ensuring the system is **scalable** to handle growth and more users.

### Full-Stack Development

This is the **"best of both worlds."** A full-stack developer is a versatile professional who is comfortable working on both the frontend and the backend of an application. They are like a Swiss army knife of development. üõ†Ô∏è

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Handling **end-to-end development**, from the user interface to the database.
- Being proficient in both frontend and backend technologies.
- Solving complex problems that span the entire application.
- Engaging in **continuous learning** to stay current with trends in both fields.
