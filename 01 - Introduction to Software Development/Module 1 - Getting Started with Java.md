- **Kotlin:** The "popular new gallery." It's the preferred language for modern Android development, offering a cleaner syntax while being fully compatible with Java

### **1.1.9. Software Development Life Cycle**

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured, seven-phase process for designing, developing, and testing high-quality software. Think of it like building a complex model with LEGOs: you plan, gather pieces, build, test, and maintain your creation.

#### **The 7 Phases of the SDLC**

1. **Planning:** This is the first step where you define the **goals of the project**, plan resources (like developers and budget), and identify potential risks. It's like deciding you want to build a LEGO castle and sketching out a rough idea
2. **Analysis:** Here, you gather and document all the **requirements from the users** and stakeholders. This ensures you know exactly what the software needs to do, much like making a list of all the specific LEGO bricks you'll need for your castle
3. **Design:** In this phase, you create a detailed **blueprint of the software**. This includes the architecture, user interface, and database structure. It's the detailed schematic you'd draw before starting to build
4. **Development:** This is the "building" phase where developers **write the actual code**, turning the design blueprint into a functional product. This is equivalent to snapping the LEGO bricks together
5. **Testing:** Once the software is built, it's rigorously tested to **find and fix bugs** and ensure all parts work as intended. You're making sure the LEGO castle's drawbridge goes up and down smoothly
6. **Deployment:** The software is **made available to users**. This can be a full release or a phased rollout. Your LEGO castle is now finished and on display for everyone to see
7. **Maintenance:** After deployment, the work continues. This phase involves **fixing any issues that arise**, making improvements, and adding new features to keep the software running smoothly over time, just like occasionally repairing a part of your LEGO model

### **1.1.10. Activity: A Simple Java Program**

It's time to get coding.

#### **Launch a Code Editor/IDE**

The course suggests using IntelliJ, which is available in the course lab's remote desktop. However, for convenience, I'm using a different approach for local development as part of my "learn and document" approach.

This guide shows you how to create, build, and run a simple Java application using a code editor and a build tool.

---

#### **1. Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **A code editor** like [Zed](https://zed.dev/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **The Java Development Kit (JDK)**, I'm using [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/install)
- **The Gradle build tool**, which you can get [here](https://gradle.org/install/)

#### **2. Create the Project Boilerplate**

First, we'll use Gradle to generate a standard project structure:

1. Open your terminal, create a new directory for your project, and navigate into it:

```bash path=null start=null
mkdir MyFirstProgram && cd MyFirstProgram
```

2. Run the Gradle initializer command:

```bash path=null start=null
gradle init
```

3. Answer the interactive prompts. This setup is crucial for letting Gradle know how to build your application:

   | Prompt                                       | Selection                       |
   | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Select the type of build to generate         | `1: application`                |
   | Select implementation language               | `1: Java`                       |
   | Enter the Java version                       | `21` (default)                  |
   | Select Project name                          | (defaults to directory name)    |
   | Select Application structure                 | `1: Single application project` |
   | Select build script DSL                      | `1: Kotlin`                     |
   | Select a test framework                      | `4: JUnit Jupiter`              |
   | Generate build using new APIs and behaviour? | `no`                            |

   Gradle will create a complete project structure, including a sample Java file.

#### **3. Understanding the Structure (the `app` folder)**

Gradle will create a structure that looks like this. This is the modern, standard way Gradle organizes projects:

- **`MyFirstProgram/` (our Root)**: This folder holds the main build configuration (`settings.gradle.kts`) and the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`). You will run all commands from here

- **`MyFirstProgram/app/` (our Module)**: This is your application's "module". It contains all your Java code and its own build file (`app/build.gradle.kts`)

All our Java code will live inside `MyFirstProgram/app/src/main/java`.

#### **4. Write the Code**

Gradle created a sample Java file. We will edit it to run our program.

1. Open the main `MyFirstProgram` folder in Zed (or your preferred IDE)

2. Navigate to the sample file Gradle created. The path is: `app/src/main/java/org/example/App.java`

3. Replace the **entire contents** of the `App.java` with your simple program. We'll keep the `package` line at the top, as it's required by Java to match the folder structure

```java path=null start=null
/*
 * This is the file we're editing:
 * app/src/main/java/org/example/App.java
 */
package org.example; // This line MUST match the folder path

public class App {
    // We are using the App class that Gradle created

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("I am a Programmer!");
    }
}
```

#### **5. Build and Run the Program**

Now, let's run your code.

1. Go back to your terminal. Make sure you are in the root `MyFirstProgram` directory (the one containing the `gradlew` file)

2. Run the application using the Gradle Wrapper:

```bash path=null start=null
./gradlew run
```

You will see the output directly in your terminal, confirming your program worked:

```plaintext path=null start=null
❯ ./gradlew run
Calculating task graph as no cached configuration is available for tasks: run

> Task :app:run
I am a Programmer!
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
