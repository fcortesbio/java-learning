# Introduction to Software Development with Java

Here I'll document my learning process while completing the Amazon Junior Software Developer with GenAI (Professional Certificate - 7 course series)

Will be adding more documentation for each component and module as lessons are completed. 

So far, I know nothing about Java. Hopefully upon completion, I'll have a few projects that will be refered in this readme as well.

Hope someone finds these notes useful.
